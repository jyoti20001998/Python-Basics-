        "      introduce by Guido van Rossum (1980). It is compatible with various programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and\n",
        "      functional programming. Python has a large and active community of developers, an extensive standard library and third-party packages for\n",
        "      various domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in python?\n",
        "   -> A Python interpreter is a computer program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It is a computer program that converts each high-level\n",
        "      program statement into machine code. An interpreter translates the command that you write out into code that the computer can understand.\n",

        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in pyhton?\n",
        "   -> This are pre-defined words that hold a special meaning and have specific purpose in python programming.You can't use a keyword anywhere else.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   -> No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because Keywords define the structure and syntax rules of a programming language and are used\n",

        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   -> Because their contents cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified.tuples are more memory-efficient\n",

        "    -> The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program by making decisions based on certain conditions.\n",
        "       Conditional statements can help make code more efficient and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    -> In Python, elif is short for \"else if\" and is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition.\n",
        "       if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks.\n",
